# Analysis and Reporting Project for Outsourced Call Center
## Project Description

As part of this project, I developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze anonymized real data from an outsourced call center. The company bills its customers based on call minutes used for three main services: technical support, billing, and sales. It pays particular attention to compliance with the service level agreement (SLA), i.e., the maximum expected wait time (Within SLA).

The main objective was to provide the regional director with a clear and comprehensive overview of the call center's operational and financial performance, enabling him to effectively monitor and manage the call center's operational (in this case, the efficiency with which the call center manages its daily activities) and financial performance. The dashboard was designed to enable accurate monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) at several levels: overall, by geographic location where customer service teams are based, and by manager and staff.
## Technical Stack

   * Power BI Desktop: Main tool used for dashboard design, data modeling, DAX measure creation, and interactive visualization.

   * DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Advanced use for date management.

   * Data Modeling: Efficient structuring of the star data model with relationships between call tables, revenue, teams, and managers.

   * Interactive Filters and Slicers: Enable smooth navigation by date, call type, site, manager, or employee.

   * Adapted Visualizations: Column charts, line charts, KPI cards, maps, and matrices to clearly represent trends and comparisons.

## Areas Studied
### Overall View of Customer Service

   * Analysis of the total number of calls overall and broken down by geographical location, with segmentation by call type (technical, billing, sales).

   * Within SLA call rate calculated and presented by location, call type, and manager, ensuring service quality monitoring.

   * Average call duration displayed, as well as number of calls, with details on variations between managers to identify areas for improvement.

   * Implementation of summary KPIs on volume and quality to provide a quick understanding of the center's performance.

### Overview of Revenue by Call

   * Clear tracking of annual revenue trends by site and call type, thanks to a precise breakdown by time period (year, quarter, month).

   * Detailed analysis of revenue by site and call type, contributing to a better understanding of major sources of revenue.

   * Revenue growth indicators presented with historical comparisons to anticipate trends.

### Overview of Manager and Staff Performance

   * Assessment of individual manager and team member performance based on call volume handled and revenue generated.

   * Analysis of wait times within SLA by team, providing key indicators for operational management and optimization.

   * Identification of top-performing managers and teams requiring support, thanks to clear, segmented visualization.

## Added Value

This dashboard has made it possible to centralize key indicators for rapid and informed decision-making by regional management. The prioritization of data ensures a focus on the essentials, while offering the possibility to explore details at the operational level.
